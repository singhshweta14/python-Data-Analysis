## Projects Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. This project has the whole set of seven courses, focuses on applying the knowledge gained from the corresponding course and showcases practical skills in data analysis, data transformation, data visualization, and machine learning.

The projects included in this repository are as follows:

1. [Project 1: New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)]

- Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.

### Overview

      - Create a project proposal outlining the objectives, scope, and deliverables of the TLC project.
      - Define milestones and set timelines for the tasks within the project.
      - Identify the key stakeholders and establish communication channels.
   
   **1.2. Building the DataFrame and Organizing Claims Data:**
      - Build a DataFrame using the TLC data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
      - Organize the claims data for further analysis, including data cleaning and preprocessing.
      - Update the project team on the progress made and share initial insights from the data.
   
   **1.3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:**
